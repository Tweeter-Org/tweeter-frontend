2. Participants/contributors have to **comment** on issues they would like to work on, and mentors or the PA will assign you.
3. Issues will be assigned on a **first-come, first-serve basis.**
4. Participants/contributors can also **open their issues** using issue_template,
but it needs to be verified and labeled by a mentor or PA. Please discuss this with the team once before opening your issues. We respect all your contributions, whether 
it is an Issue or a Pull Request.
6. When you raise an issue, make sure you get it assigned to you before you start working on that project.
